In this experiment i made a Live Character Counter in which Javascript was integrated along with the HTMLand CSS . In javascript , a function was made that was triggered when the event was happening (when the characters were typed , the count was changing . I used two attributes here textArea and charCount and those were involved in the textCount function in Javascript . I accesed their values using values.length .
