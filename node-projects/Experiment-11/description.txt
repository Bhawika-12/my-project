Title:

REST API for Playing Card Collection Using Express.js

Objective:

To build a simple RESTful API using Express.js to manage a collection of playing cards.

Description:

This project creates a Node.js backend that allows adding, listing, retrieving by ID, and deleting playing cards. Cards are stored in an in-memory array with properties: id, suit, and value. The API includes endpoints:

GET / → Welcome message

GET /cards → List all cards

POST /cards → Add a new card

GET /cards/:id → Get a card by ID

DELETE /cards/:id → Remove a card

The API uses JSON for data exchange and basic error handling.

Learning Outcomes:

Setting up Express.js server

Handling GET, POST, DELETE requests

Working with JSON data

Testing APIs using browser and PowerShell
